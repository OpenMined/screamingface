"""Audit the `ignore:` rules in .github/dependabot.yml so they expire instead of rotting.

An ignore rule is a promise that something upstream is broken. Promises rot: when the blocker
lifts, nothing notices, and a tree stays pinned majors behind for a reason that expired. This
re-checks every promise against live data.

Two checks, with DELIBERATELY different severities:

  DRIFT  -> exit 1.  An ignore with no registry entry, or an entry with no ignore, is OUR OWN
                     inconsistency and is always fixable on the spot. Failing here is what stops
                     an undocumented ignore ever landing.

  LIFTED -> exit 0.  A blocker that has cleared only WARNS. Failing a PR because upstream shipped
                     a release would train people to disable the check, which is strictly worse
                     than the rot it was meant to catch. The weekly scheduled run is what makes
                     these visible.

Usage:
    uv run .claude/scripts/audit_dependabot_ignores.py [--offline]

`--offline` skips registry lookups (drift checks still run) so the audit is usable without
network — e.g. in a pre-commit hook.
