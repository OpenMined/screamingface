 * Activate / deactivate a tenant.
 *
 * INVARIANT: no `@/lib/*` import — the server action arrives as a prop, already bound to this
 * account and to the state it moves to. See `delete-profile-button.tsx` for the same rule.
 *
 * The copy states the actual consequence, verified against the gateway: `account_for_identity`
 * returns None for a deactivated account and `current_account` turns that into
 * `401 Account not found or inactive`, on every request, in both auth modes. The profiles are left
 * alone, so this is a lockout and not a deletion.
