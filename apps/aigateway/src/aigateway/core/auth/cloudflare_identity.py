"""Resolving the caller from the identity header the mesh gateway injects.

https://pulse.dev.openmined.org/docs/products/gateway-identity-flow/ — Cloudflare Access
authenticates the caller at the edge and issues a signed assertion; the request reaches the cluster
through a `cloudflared` tunnel, where Envoy **re-verifies that assertion against Cloudflare's JWKS**
and translates the verified claims into plain HTTP headers. Envoy also clears any client-supplied
copy of those headers first, so a caller cannot forge one.

The gateway therefore does no token work of its own: identity arrives as `X-User-Email`, already
verified. (An earlier design had aigateway verify the Cloudflare JWT itself, JWKS fetching and all —
that moved to Envoy, which is why none of it lives here.)

INVARIANT: the trust is a property of the NETWORK, not of this module. It holds only while
aigateway is unreachable except through that chain. Expose this port directly and anyone can claim
any identity with one header. Nothing here can detect that, so the mode is opt-in, not default.

The account this produces is an ordinary `Account` row, so everything downstream — profiles,
`credential_blobs`, the request cache — keeps working unchanged.
