"""OME-479 pure rule algebra.

FEATURE: effective model-capability contract — the verbs half. Every function
here is pure: it takes the value objects from ``._types`` and returns new ones,
touching no provider, no cache, and no request.

INVARIANT: only a gateway RULE authorizes a parameter. These derivations may move
provider support, provenance, staleness and lifecycle, and they may make an
unruled path VISIBLE as a disabled row — but none of them can enable a path the
provider's rules did not already enable.

AIDEV-NOTE: import these from the ``chat_parameters`` PACKAGE, never from this
module directly — the split between halves is an implementation detail and may
move again.

    claim decides — so the detailed contract stops reporting the same evidence for
    every model of a provider.

    INVARIANT (evidence axis only): this moves ``support`` / ``source`` / ``stale``

    than one axis, and different sources speak on different ones. A per-model catalog
    reports SUPPORT and knows nothing about a field's schema or lifecycle, so letting
    it win wholesale would erase endpoint facts it never contradicted — the same
    "partial source read as a denial" bug, one level down. ``schema`` and
