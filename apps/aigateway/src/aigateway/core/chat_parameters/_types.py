"""OME-479 contract vocabulary and immutable value objects.

FEATURE: effective model-capability contract — the nouns half. This module owns
the published enums, the disabled-reason vocabulary, the construction-time
errors, and the frozen value objects the contract is composed from. The pure
derivations over them live in ``._algebra``.

INVARIANT: nothing here reads or writes provider state. Every type is frozen and
``extra="forbid"``, so a malformed rule or observation fails closed at
construction rather than surfacing as a wrong contract row later.

AIDEV-NOTE: import these from the ``chat_parameters`` PACKAGE, never from this
module directly — the split between halves is an implementation detail and may
move again. Value VALIDATION lives in ``._schema`` (``ParameterSchema`` and its
vocabulary); the dependency runs one way, this module → ``._schema``.
