"""Process-wide cache of credential strategy instances (SF-282).

Concurrent ``POST /v1/chat/completions`` requests for the same credential must
share ONE strategy instance so its ``asyncio.Lock`` single-flights the OAuth
refresh. Without this, each request built a fresh ``BaseOAuthStrategy`` with its
own per-instance lock, so a fan-out (e.g. a 33-row eval) refreshed the same
rotating OAuth token N times in parallel and the provider rejected the racers
(Anthropic returns ``429 refresh_token_conflict``).

``get_or_create`` and ``evict`` are intentionally **synchronous**: asyncio is
single-threaded and neither method contains an ``await``, so check-then-insert
is atomic without a lock. The actual refresh single-flight is the shared
strategy's own lock (``BaseOAuthStrategy._lock``), not this cache.

The cache MUST be evicted on every credential mutation (OAuth re-auth, delete,
manual refresh) so a cached, not-yet-expired access token cannot outlive the
stored credential. API-key strategies hold no in-memory token (they read the
store on every call), so api-key paths do not require eviction.
