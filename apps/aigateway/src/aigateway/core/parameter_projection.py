"""OME-479 Phase 4: fail-closed chat-parameter classification + projection.

FEATURE: effective parameter contract — dispatch side. The SAME provider rule
set that drives the ``/v1/models`` summary and the detailed
``/v1/model-parameters`` document decides HERE which caller-supplied optional
parameters may be dispatched, and projects each accepted value to its target in
a fresh normalized provider body.

INVARIANT: fail closed. A caller-supplied optional parameter is dispatched ONLY
when an enabled rule matching the REAL auth mode authorizes it. Every other
optional field — unknown, wrong-auth, malformed, duplicate-channel, or a
``provider_params`` wrapper that is not an object — is rejected with HTTP-safe
request paths, BEFORE credential injection and provider dispatch. Presence,
provider support, or staleness never authorize a parameter; only a rule does.

INVARIANT: required-protocol, gateway-owned, and transport fields are NOT
optional model parameters and never need a rule (``model``, ``messages``,
``stream``, ``extra_headers``, ``metadata``, ``timeout``). Caller LiteLLM
control-plane fields are already removed upstream (``strip_dispatch_controls``)
before this runs, so they are neither seen nor re-classified here.

INVARIANT (SOLID/hexagonal): provider-agnostic. No provider-name switch and no
central parameter inventory — a new parameter is enabled by a provider-local
rule + projection target only, with no edit to this module (plan §12 P0).
