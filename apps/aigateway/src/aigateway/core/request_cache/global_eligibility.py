"""OME-305 — what an effective request consists of for global cache purposes.

FEATURE: one global exact-request cache. Before anything can be hashed, the
gateway has to decide which parts of a request are output-affecting facts, which
are transport noise, and which make the request uncacheable altogether. This
module owns that decision; ``.global_keys`` owns turning the answer into a hash.

INVARIANT: the field enumeration here is CLOSED. Every key in the request body is
either prompt material, a reviewed structural field named below, the one
``provider_params`` wrapper, or a request path a provider RULE dispositions.
Anything else bypasses. A key this module fails to account for is a key that
silently does not participate in the hash — which is the one failure mode a shared
cache may never have.

INVARIANT: no identity. Nothing here takes an account, profile, user, auth mode or
credential, and the provider projection is called with the request body alone.

AIDEV-NOTE (OME-653 pattern): split out of ``.global_keys`` purely to keep each
file within the repository's 450-line limit. ``.global_keys`` is the public
surface and re-exports every name below; import from there.

AIDEV-NOTE: this enumeration is deliberately NOT a copy of
``parameter_projection._addressed_request_paths``. That one answers "which paths
does the auth-specific classifier adjudicate" and may legitimately skip a key it
rejects elsewhere. This one must ACCOUNT FOR every key.
