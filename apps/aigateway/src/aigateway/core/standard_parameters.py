"""Reusable OpenAI-compatible parameter schemas + rule builders (OME-479 §4.2).

Provider plugins SELECT from these to compose their own rule sets. Defining the
bounded schema for a standard field ONCE stops providers from disagreeing about
what ``temperature`` means, while each plugin still owns which fields it enables,
under which auth modes, and where each value projects.

INVARIANT (SOLID/hexagonal): no provider names appear here. This module is the
shared vocabulary; the choice of which words to speak stays provider-local, so
enabling a new parameter is a provider-local edit, never a change here.
