"""Anthropic chat-parameter rules (OME-479 §6.1/§6.3) — proven set only.

INVARIANT (§9): every rule here is backed by a test proving the caller param
reaches the Anthropic dispatch body — the standard fields through the INSTALLED
litellm ``AnthropicConfig`` transform (``test_anthropic_parameter_projection``),
so enabling a field is earned, not speculative.

Auth-mode split (§6.3 — Anthropic offers BOTH api-key and OAuth):

- ``reasoning_effort``, ``temperature``, ``max_tokens``, ``top_p`` — standard
  fields whose forwarding is auth-agnostic (the OAuth Claude-Code attribution
  block only rewrites messages/system; the SAME transform then runs), so they are
  enabled under BOTH modes and survive the conservative summary intersection.
- ``provider_params.top_k`` → native top-level ``top_k`` — enabled for API KEY
  ONLY. The direct api-key path is transform-verifiable here; the OAuth Claude-Code
  SUBSCRIPTION path's native-param forwarding is uncaptured in v1 and §6.3 forbids
  credentialed discovery, so OAuth "cannot prove it". It therefore surfaces ENABLED
  in the api-key detailed contract but is DROPPED from the inline summary
  intersection. Because the global key is built before auth resolution, its presence
  bypasses the cache. Promoting it for OAuth later needs a captured-body proof.

# AIDEV-NOTE: the caller-facing wrapper ``provider_params.top_k`` matches OpenRouter
# for client consistency; only the projection TARGET is provider-specific (top-level
# top_k here vs extra_body.top_k for OpenRouter). ``stop`` is a standard field the
# INSTALLED transform renames to ``stop_sequences`` (proven under both auth modes).
