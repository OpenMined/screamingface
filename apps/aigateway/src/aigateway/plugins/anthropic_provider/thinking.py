"""Anthropic thinking cross-field rules (OME-479 §4.5, OME-640).

FEATURE: one effective parameter contract. ``reasoning_effort`` and ``max_tokens``
each validate alone, but on a MANUAL-thinking model the installed transform turns
the effort into a thinking BUDGET, and Anthropic's Messages API requires that
budget to be smaller than ``max_tokens``. So the pair has to be refused where the
contract is decided, not discovered as an opaque provider error after dispatch.

INVARIANT: this is the ONLY place the constraint lives. It is provider-local by
design — ``core/parameter_projection.py`` carries a "no provider-name switch"
invariant, so the model list, the budget ladder and the auth split all stay here
and reach the route through the ``validate_chat_parameter_combination`` hook.

Three facts, each measured against the INSTALLED litellm and each pinned by a
test in ``tests/unit/anthropic/test_anthropic_thinking_conflict.py``:

1. ``AnthropicConfig._map_reasoning_effort`` branches on
   ``_is_adaptive_thinking_model(model)`` BEFORE it reads the effort value. The
   three adaptive models therefore emit ``thinking={"type":"adaptive"}`` with no
   budget at all — the constraint does not exist for them and applying it would
   refuse legal requests on most of the fleet.
2. ``BaseConfig.update_optional_params_with_thinking_tokens`` raises ``max_tokens``
   above the budget itself, but ONLY when the caller supplied none. So the invalid
   pair is reachable exactly when ``max_tokens`` is present.
3. The exemption is auth-shaped, and the split lives in the credential layer:
   ``AnthropicOAuth._build_headers`` sends ``anthropic-beta`` including
   ``interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14``; the api-key path sends no beta header at
   all. Under interleaved thinking the budget may exceed ``max_tokens`` — but
   interleaved thinking is defined as extended thinking WITH TOOL USE, so the
   header alone is not enough.
