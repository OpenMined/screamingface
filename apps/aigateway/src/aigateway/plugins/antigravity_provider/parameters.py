"""Antigravity chat-parameter rules (OME-634, OME-479 §Phase 9) — proven set only.

INVARIANT: every rule here is backed by a characterization test that runs the
request pipeline and proves the value reaches ``build_generate_content_body`` — the
last AIGateway-owned boundary before the Code Assist wire body — so enabling it is
earned, not speculative (§6.2, §9).

INVARIANT: Antigravity is OAuth-ONLY (``supports_api_key()`` is ``False``), so every
rule declares that single mode. Publishing an api-key mode would advertise a path
dispatch cannot take.

Two shapes of enabled field, exactly as the builder reads them:

- STANDARD OpenAI fields its ``config_map`` renames (``temperature``,
  ``top_p`` → ``topP``, ``max_tokens`` → ``maxOutputTokens``) plus ``stop`` →
  ``stopSequences`` — kept at their identity path as ``direct`` rules.
- The provider-NATIVE ``top_k`` (not an OpenAI param) — a ``provider_native`` rule
  from the ``provider_params.top_k`` wrapper to the top-level key the builder reads.

# AIDEV-NOTE: this set mirrors Gemini's because the two builders are the same shape,
# NOT because one provider inherits the other's evidence. They are different
# upstreams; each is proven independently and labelled with its own source. If one
# builder changes, only that provider's rules move.
