"""Codex chat-parameter rules (OME-634, OME-479 §Phase 9) — proven set only.

Codex is NOT an OpenAI Chat Completions provider. It rides the ChatGPT subscription
Responses endpoint, and ``chat_handler._build_payload`` — the last AIGateway-owned
boundary before that wire — copies only a FIXED set of keys out of
``optional_params`` (``tools``, ``tool_choice``, ``reasoning``,
``previous_response_id``, ``truncation``, plus a merged ``include``). Everything else
is DROPPED before the request leaves the gateway.

INVARIANT (§9): a rule is earned only by proving the value survives that copy. That
makes the enabled set deliberately narrow — and the narrowness is the honest report,
not an oversight:

- ``reasoning_effort`` IS enabled. ``plugin.prepare_chat_body`` converts it to
  ``reasoning: {"effort": …}``, which ``_build_payload`` carries. The conversion
  already existed; without this rule the classifier rejected the field first, so it
  was unreachable.
- Sampling (``temperature``, ``top_p``, ``max_tokens``) is NOT enabled. The transform
  drops it, so a rule would accept the caller's value and silently discard it. A
  refusal the caller can see beats a promise the wire never keeps.
- ``tools``/``tool_choice`` are NOT enabled. ``_build_payload`` forwards a caller's
  array VERBATIM, but the two tool shapes are not interchangeable: Chat Completions
  nests the definition under ``function``, the Responses API expects it flattened
  beside ``type`` (litellm 1.87.0's own converter,
  ``responses/litellm_completion_transformation/transformation.py``, is the
  authority). Function calling here needs a shape adapter in the transform first.
- ``previous_response_id`` is NOT enabled: the payload hardcodes ``store: False``, so
  no response is ever persisted to continue from.

# AIDEV-NOTE: adding a rule here is only half the work — check ``_build_payload``
# first. If the key is not in its copy list, the value dies inside the gateway.

# AIDEV-NOTE (OME-305, owner decision B — READ BEFORE CHANGING A ``cache_behavior``).
# Every rule below states ``cache_behavior="bypass"`` EXPLICITLY. That is a disposition,
# not an oversight, and it is not a judgement about the parameter: each of these values
# is output-affecting and WOULD have to be keyed for a cached answer to be correct.
#
# The reason they are not keyed is that THIS PROVIDER DOES NOT IMPLEMENT
# ``global_cache_projection`` — it inherits the ``CacheBypass`` default from
# ``ProviderPluginBase``. While that is true, every request to this provider bypasses
# the cache at the projection step regardless of any rule, so declaring ``keyed`` here
# would change no behaviour while advertising a cacheable parameter to callers that can
# never be cached. ``test_a_provider_that_declares_a_keyed_rule_backs_it_with_a_real_projection``
# in ``tests/unit/test_global_cache_registry_conformance.py`` is what enforces that.
#
# TO PROMOTE THESE: implement ``global_cache_projection`` for this provider FIRST, then
# flip these to ``keyed`` in the same change. The order matters — the conformance sweep
# will refuse the flip on its own, which is the intended guard rail rather than an
# obstacle. Anthropic and OpenRouter are the two providers that have the projection and
# therefore carry keyed rules today.
