"""Gemini chat-parameter rules (OME-479 §Phase 9) — currently-proven set only.

INVARIANT: every rule here is backed by a characterization test that runs the
request pipeline and proves the value reaches ``build_generate_content_body``'s
``generationConfig`` — the last AIGateway-owned boundary that emits the Gemini
wire body — so enabling it is earned, not speculative (plan §12; §6.2). Both
dispatch paths (direct ``generateContent`` and the OAuth Code Assist envelope)
call that SAME builder, so every rule applies under BOTH auth modes; there is no
param-level auth asymmetry to fabricate (contrast Anthropic's api-key-only top_k).

Two shapes of enabled field:

- STANDARD OpenAI sampling fields the builder's ``config_map`` renames
  (``temperature``, ``top_p`` → ``topP``, ``max_tokens`` → ``maxOutputTokens``) —
  kept on the request as ``direct`` rules at their identity path.
- The provider-NATIVE ``top_k`` (not an OpenAI param) — a ``provider_native`` rule
  from the ``provider_params.top_k`` wrapper to the top-level ``top_k`` key the
  builder's ``config_map`` reads (renamed to ``topK``).

# AIDEV-NOTE: ``stop`` (OpenAI ``string | array[string]``) is ruled via the shared
# union ``STOP_SCHEMA``; the builder renames it to ``stopSequences`` (scalar coerced
# to a one-element list). Enabled under both auth modes since both dispatch paths run
# the SAME builder. A wrong-typed array item fails closed as malformed.
