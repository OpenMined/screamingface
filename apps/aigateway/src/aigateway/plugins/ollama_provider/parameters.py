"""Ollama chat-parameter rules (OME-636, OME-479 §Phase 9) — proven set only.

Ollama is the one provider whose final transform is not AIGateway code at all.
``prepare_chat_body`` rewrites ``ollama/<name>`` to ``ollama_chat/<name>`` and
hands the body to LiteLLM, so the last boundary before the wire is LiteLLM's own
``OllamaChatConfig.map_openai_params``. Every rule below was earned by running
that mapping and reading the parameters it emits.

INVARIANT (§9): a provider's DECLARED support list is not evidence — the mapping
is. ``get_supported_openai_params()`` names ``tool_choice``, but
``map_openai_params`` has no branch for it and pops it, noting upstream that it
hangs Ollama requests. Trusting the declaration would have advertised a control
the wire never receives.

INVARIANT: "carried" is necessary but NOT sufficient — the mapping must also
preserve MEANING. ``frequency_penalty`` is carried, and is still not enabled: the
transform renames it to ``repeat_penalty``, a different scale. OpenAI's ``0``
means "no penalty" and is the common client default, while Ollama disables at
``1.0`` and treats ``0`` as degenerate. An inverted default silently changes
generation; a dropped field at least leaves default behavior intact. So the
honest refusal wins, and enabling it later needs a value transform, not a rule.

Enabled paths and the wire keys they reach:

- ``temperature``, ``top_p``, ``seed``, ``stop`` — unchanged.
- ``max_tokens`` → ``num_predict``.
- ``response_format`` → ``format`` (``json_object`` → ``"json"``; ``json_schema``
  → the schema object; ``text`` emits nothing, which IS Ollama's free-form
  default, so the caller's request is honored exactly).
- ``reasoning_effort`` → ``think``, coarsened to a boolean outside the
  ``gpt-oss`` family (``low|medium|high`` → True). Carried at reduced resolution,
  direction preserved.
- ``tools`` → ``tools``, passed through in the OpenAI nested shape Ollama 0.4+
  accepts — no adapter needed, unlike a Responses backend.

``presence_penalty`` and ``n`` stay unsupported: the transform RAISES on them, and
the classifier's earlier refusal is the better error and costs no credential read.

# AIDEV-NOTE: these rules are pinned to litellm's mapping, not to Ollama's API.
# Before adding one, run ``get_optional_params(custom_llm_provider="ollama_chat")``
# and read the emitted key — a rule for a field litellm drops or renames onto a
# different scale is worse than no rule at all.
