"""Shared scaffolding for the OME-305 registry-wide global-cache sweeps.

Not a test module. It builds the REAL provider registry once and exposes the
(plugin, model) pairs the conformance and purity suites both sweep.

INVARIANT (plan §12): no provider name and no model inventory appears here. Every
helper works by SHAPE, so a provider added later is swept automatically and a
provider removed later takes its coverage with it.

EXCEPTION, and there is exactly one: ``MODEL_LESS_PROVIDERS`` names a provider. It is
recorded deliberately and is not an inventory — see its own comment. The invariant
exists so coverage follows the registry rather than a hand-maintained list; that one
constant serves the same goal from the other side, by making an environment-dependent
DROP in coverage fail loudly instead of silently. Do not add a second name here for any
other reason.

WHY a private sibling module and not a conftest: a conftest is imported by every
suite in the directory, so scaffolding for two cache suites would become ambient for
all of them. This follows the existing ``tests/unit/_pg_mvcc_store`` precedent —
imported explicitly by exactly the suites that want it.

AIDEV-NOTE: the registry is built ONCE at import and shared. That is deliberate —
``load_plugins`` probes for a local Ollama process, and doing it per suite is slow
noise. It also means no test may mutate ``REGISTRY`` or a plugin it yields; build a
twin instance instead (see ``operator_gate_overrides``).
