"""OME-648 — the dynamic source revision is published, hashed, and agreed on.

FEATURE: profile-bound detailed parameter contract. A provider's ``source_revision``
versions the gateway's READING of a source, not merely the URL it dialed. The same
bytes can mean different things under a different reading, so the revision is part
of the contract's IDENTITY and part of its published metadata.

STORY: as a client that caches on ``contract_id``, I am never handed a contract whose
evidence was read from different documents, or under a different reading, while the
id I pinned stays the same.

INVARIANT (identity): a revision change moves BOTH opaque ids — even when the
resulting observations are byte-identical. A digest that omitted it would fail
DANGEROUSLY: a semantically reinterpreted contract served under a frozen id.
INVARIANT (agreement): the cache key is built from the ref a provider declares BEFORE
the fetch, while the evidence carries its own stamp. If those disagree, the entry
would be stored under a reading that did not produce it — so the attempt fails and
the honest stale/degraded path takes over.
