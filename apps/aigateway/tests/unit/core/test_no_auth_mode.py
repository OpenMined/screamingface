"""OME-636: the explicit no-auth mode, and why it cannot be forged.

FEATURE: honest auth reporting for a provider that needs no credentials. The
gateway had only ``oauth`` and ``api_key``, so a local Ollama host resolved to
``oauth`` — a fiction, and the value every parameter rule, the summary
intersection and the detailed contract were then matched against.

STORY: as a caller on a local no-auth provider, the gateway tells me the mode is
``none`` instead of naming a credential type nobody holds; and as an operator, I
cannot store or send that mode, because it exists only as the OUTCOME of
resolution.

INVARIANT: PERSISTED credential types stay ``oauth | api_key``; the RESOLVED mode
is the separate, wider ``AuthMode``. The split is what makes ``none``
unforgeable — no persisted model or request schema ever widens to accept it, so
the type checker enforces it rather than a validation rule someone can forget.
INVARIANT: ``none`` is resolved from the PROVIDER's own declaration, never from a
missing profile. A provider that merely permits a profile-less request still
resolves to a real mode.
