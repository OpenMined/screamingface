"""OME-640: the provider-agnostic cross-field validation seam.

FEATURE: one effective parameter contract. A per-field rule cannot express "these
two individually-valid fields cannot be sent together on THIS model under THIS
auth mode", so providers get one bounded seam to say it — and core stays free of
provider names.

INVARIANT: the seam is opt-in. A provider that says nothing keeps dispatching
exactly as before; no field becomes newly refusable because the hook exists.
INVARIANT: the conflict error carries SAFE request paths and a reason string
only — never a raw submitted value, exactly like ``UnsupportedParametersError``.
