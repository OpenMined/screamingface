"""Phase 10 (OME-479 §Phase 10): provider-AGNOSTIC contract conformance.

FEATURE: the effective-parameter contract's cross-provider guarantees. Instead of
per-provider assertions, this suite DISCOVERS the real registry (`load_plugins`) and
iterates EVERY registered model, so the algebra's invariants are locked for every
current AND future provider — a new plugin that violates them fails here, not in prod.

STORY: as a gateway maintainer adding a provider, I get an automatic guarantee that my
plugin's models route to me, that my summary never overclaims an auth-specific field,
that a locked/transport field cannot be turned on by an ordinary rule, and that every
param I enable is fully evidenced — without editing any central inventory.

INVARIANT (SOLID/hexagonal — plan §12): this file contains NO provider-name literal and
NO hardcoded model/provider inventory. The registry is the single source of truth; the
core composes, the plugins select. (The ONE legitimately-named regression guard — "Codex
GPT-family ids never surface under an `openai` namespace" — lives in the codex-owned test
file, where naming codex is domain-correct, not inventory.)
INVARIANT (§4.4): a RULE is the only thing that enables a parameter; an observation only
adds visibility. Every enabled entry here is proven rule-backed AND fully evidenced.
