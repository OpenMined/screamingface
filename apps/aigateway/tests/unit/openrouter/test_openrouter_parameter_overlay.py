"""Phase 6c (OME-479 §4.4/§6.1): OpenRouter detail-contract observation overlay.

FEATURE: OpenRouter P0 observation overlay — the detailed /v1/model-parameters
document. Proves the composition the route performs (build_model_parameter_
document over the plugin's OWN rules + observations) surfaces EVERY endpoint-
accepted field with an honest gateway status, from labelled-local evidence and
with NO network.

STORY: as an API consumer, every field OpenRouter accepts is visible here with an
honest gateway status — so I know exactly what I may send. A field the gateway does
not project is visible-but-DISABLED rather than hidden.

INVARIANT (§4.4): an observation NEVER enables a field; only a rule does. An
observed-but-unruled field stays visible-but-rejected (projection_not_implemented).
Since OME-479 closure Unit 2 promoted top_p — the last OpenRouter path that was
observed with no rule — that case is constructed by withholding a rule from the
composer, which isolates the rule as the sole authorizing input.
INVARIANT: no network — the detail endpoint composes from labelled-local evidence.
