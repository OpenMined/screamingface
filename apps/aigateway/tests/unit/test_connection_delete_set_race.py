"""OME-307 Blocker 3 — atomic connection revoke/delete versus a racing API-key replace.

FEATURE: deleting an api-key connection (connection row + credential blob) and replacing the
API key on that same connection (``set_connection_api_key``).
STORY: as a user who deletes a connection while an API-key replace for that same connection is
still in flight, the delete wins cleanly — no encrypted credential is left behind under a
revoked connection, and the older replace does not silently reactivate the connection I just
deleted.

INVARIANT: ``set_connection_api_key`` and ``delete_connection`` each publish the
connection-row transition and the credential blob write/delete in ONE transaction, in ONE
consistent lock order — the ALWAYS-PRESENT connection row FIRST, the credential blob SECOND.
Serializing on the credential row instead fails when that row is ABSENT: a missing-row delete
takes no lock under READ COMMITTED, so it cannot serialize a concurrent INSERT, orphaning a
credential under a revoked connection. This is the connection analogue of the profile
delete/set-api-key race in ``test_profile_delete_set_race.py``.

WHY a store double: the gateway unit harness is SQLite-only and serializes whole transactions
on one connection, so it cannot exhibit the PostgreSQL per-row interleaving this race needs. In
production the connection row (``oauth_connections``) and the credential blob
(``credential_blobs``) live in the SAME database and are published in ONE ``in_transaction()``,
so they share one MVCC snapshot and lock manager — modelled here as two keys in one
``MvccRowStore``. The connection-row operations transcribe the VERIFIED production semantics:
``OAuthConnectionStore.reactivate`` is a conditional CAS (``UPDATE ... WHERE status IN
('active','error')``; 0 rows -> ``None`` -> the route raises 409 -> rollback) and
``OAuthConnectionStore.mark_revoked`` is an unconditional ``UPDATE`` by primary key. The real
methods' sequential behaviour is guarded by the route-level tests in
``test_api_key_connection_races.py``; this file guards the per-row lock-ordering invariant those
serialized tests cannot exercise.
