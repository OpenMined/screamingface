"""OME-305 U2 — provider-AGNOSTIC conformance for the global cache projection.

FEATURE: one global exact-request cache. A provider makes a parameter cacheable by
declaring ``cache_behavior="keyed"`` on its own rule, and describes its own
output-affecting preparation through ``global_cache_projection``. Nothing central
lists which parameters or which providers those are — so the guarantees have to be
swept over the REAL registry instead of an inventory.

STORY: as a gateway maintainer promoting a parameter to ``keyed``, I get an
automatic guarantee that the key builder can actually see and hash that path, and
that my provider has a pure projection to back the promise — without editing any
central table.

INVARIANT (SOLID/hexagonal, plan §12): no provider name and no model inventory in
this file. The registry is the source of truth.

INVARIANT under test — an honest ``cache_behavior``. A rule that says ``keyed``
publishes a promise in the detailed contract; these tests prove the pipeline can
keep it. The v1 guard expressed this as "a non-bypass path must be one of
``model``/``messages``/``system``", which was true only while the key was
prompt-only. The generalized form is: a non-bypass path must be a path the v2 key
builder can SEE and does not structurally exclude.

AIDEV-NOTE on what is deliberately NOT swept here: per-value key sensitivity.
Two distinct caller values SHOULD usually produce two keys, but not always — a
provider may normalize ``"1"``, ``"1.0"`` and ``"1.000"`` to one canonical price
on purpose, and that equivalence is exactly what its own named tests must pin.
Generic value generation would also need a value satisfying an arbitrary
pattern-constrained schema, which is not decidable here. Sensitivity is guaranteed
structurally instead: the DTO carries each accepted value verbatim under its
request path, so two different values cannot collide unless the PROVIDER collapsed
them.
