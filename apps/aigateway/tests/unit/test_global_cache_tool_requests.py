"""OME-782/OME-787 — tool-bearing requests are cacheable, opt-in per provider.

FEATURE: ``tools``/``tool_choice`` presence used to bypass the global cache
unconditionally (OME-305 plan §1.3). An owner decision (D1) lifted the
STRUCTURAL carve-out: a cached entry represents ONE model call, and a tool
RESULT the caller sends back arrives in ``messages``, which is hashed
verbatim — so a differing tool result already yields a differing key. There
is nothing left for a blanket presence bypass to protect.

A second owner decision (OME-787) then scoped the ROLLOUT: whether
``tools``/``tool_choice`` actually key is now an ordinary per-provider
``cache_behavior`` choice, defaulted to ``"bypass"`` in
``function_calling_rules`` — a provider is promoted to ``"keyed"`` only once
its ``global_cache_projection`` can back the rule. This file exercises a
FABRICATED provider that has opted in (passes ``cache_behavior="keyed"``,
mirroring the one real provider that has today: OpenRouter).

STORY: as a benchmark operator I re-run the identical tool-bearing request —
same tools, same order, same choice — against a provider that has opted in,
from a second account, and the second call is answered from the first one's
stored response.

INVARIANT under test: an OPTED-IN provider's declared function-calling rules
govern whether ``tools``/``tool_choice`` key or bypass, exactly like any
other parameter — there is no longer a structural carve-out for their mere
presence. ``metadata`` keeps its own, unrelated, presence bypass (untouched
by D1) even on a request that also carries tools. A provider that has NOT
opted in keeps bypassing tools, via the ordinary declared-bypass path.

AIDEV-NOTE: copies the ``_build``/``_hash``/``_reason`` harness from
test_global_cache_key.py verbatim rather than importing it — that module's
helpers are private to it.
