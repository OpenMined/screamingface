"""OME-307 Unit 3 — atomic profile deletion versus a racing API-key set.

FEATURE: deleting a profile (credential blob + profile-index entry) and setting an API key
on the same profile.
STORY: as a user who deletes a profile while an API-key set for that same profile is still
in flight, the delete wins cleanly — no encrypted credential is left behind with no profile,
and the older API-key writer does not silently resurrect the profile I just deleted.

INVARIANT: credential deletion and profile-index removal are published in ONE transaction,
so a committed delete never leaves an orphan credential. An API-key publication that
observed the profile as existing must NOT recreate it if a concurrent delete removed it
first; it aborts with ProfileTransitionConflict (the retryable conflict), and its own
credential write rolls back. This is the profile analogue of the connection delete /
set-api-key CAS the codebase already relies on.

WHY a store double: the gateway test harness is SQLite-only and serializes whole
transactions on one connection, so it cannot exhibit the PostgreSQL per-row interleaving
this race needs (review requirement). ``_PostgresRowLockStore`` models the relevant PostgreSQL
READ COMMITTED behavior — an UPDATE/DELETE inside a transaction takes that row's lock until
COMMIT, and the transaction rolls back its own row writes on failure — so two independent
tasks contend exactly as two PostgreSQL backends would, on the same event loop.
