"""OME-307 Unit 2 — OAuth flow generation ownership.

FEATURE: profile OAuth authentication with concurrent-flow safety.
STORY: as a user who restarts an OAuth login for a profile while an earlier attempt is
still exchanging its code, the earlier (stale) attempt must not hijack the profile the
new attempt now owns.

INVARIANT: pending-profile publication is bound to the CURRENT OAuth operation, not
merely to ``profile.state == pending``. A stale callback whose operation has been
superseded by a newer pending flow for the same account/provider/profile receives the
retryable ``profile_auth_conflict`` (409) and modifies neither the credential nor the
profile owned by the newer flow. The profile-state CAS remains as defense in depth for
the case where the newer flow has already committed.
