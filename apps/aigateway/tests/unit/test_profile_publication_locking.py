"""OME-307 Unit 1 — profile publication must not deadlock under PostgreSQL row locking.

FEATURE: OAuth/API-key profile publication (credential blob + profile-index write).
STORY: as an operator completing two profile authentications for the same account on a
PostgreSQL-backed gateway worker, both publications complete instead of deadlocking.

INVARIANT: ``ProfileIndexStore.authenticate_pending`` performs exactly ONE conditional
durable publication under a SINGLE acquisition of the process ``asyncio.Lock``. It must
never RELEASE that lock and then RE-ACQUIRE it while the enclosing OAuth transaction
(``routes/auth.py`` ``_complete_oauth_for_app`` → ``in_transaction()``) still holds the
profile-index row lock. A second acquisition inverts the application-lock / database-
row-lock order between two concurrent writers and deadlocks: on PostgreSQL the waiter
that holds the process lock is blocked *in-process*, invisible to the database deadlock
detector, so nothing ever breaks the cycle.

WHY a store double: the gateway test harness is SQLite-only (``conftest``), and SQLite
serializes whole transactions on one global connection lock, so it *cannot* exhibit the
PostgreSQL per-row inversion — using it as evidence would be unsound (review requirement).
``_PostgresRowLockStore`` below models the relevant PostgreSQL READ COMMITTED behavior: an UPDATE
(``mutate``) executed inside a transaction takes that row's lock and holds it until the
transaction COMMITs, so an independent task's UPDATE on the same row blocks until the
first commits — exactly as two PostgreSQL backends contend. No database or service is
added; this runs on the same event loop as every other unit test.
