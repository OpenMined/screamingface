"""IFEval as one Engine-owned Benchmark family — deterministic verification, no judge.

FEATURE: the first judge-free benchmark — 541 instruction-following prompts graded by
vendored deterministic code (arXiv:2311.07911), zero judge calls.
STORY: as a researcher, I measure whether an ensemble's reducer PRESERVES instructions
the members satisfied — the failure mode LLM synthesizers are known for.

# WHY: nltk>=3.10 installs a CWD import guard (nltk/inisec.py, CWE-427 mitigation) whose
# under-the-cwd check false-positives on in-project virtualenvs — ANY nltk-initiated
# dependency import resolving beneath the project directory (…/.venv/site-packages/…)
# raises ImportError, breaking the vendored verifier. Every execution context here (CI,
# the read-only Runner Job image) runs from a trusted, non-attacker-writable directory,
# so standard Python import semantics are acceptable. setdefault preserves an explicit
# host opt-in; must run before the first `import nltk` anywhere in the process.
