Found while addressing PR #390 review (OME-391): `postgres_schema_database_url` in
`apps/scoreboard/tests/conftest.py` calls `asyncio.run()` from inside an already-running
pytest-asyncio event loop, which raises immediately — and CI never sets
`SCOREBOARD_TEST_DATABASE_URL` anyway, so the two `test_postgres_concurrent_*` tests in
`test_store.py` have only ever skipped, never actually run.

Fix: convert the fixture to async, add a `postgres:16` CI service, and ideally a
migration-chain-vs-model-drift check (assert `content_hash`'s unique index exists after
running real migrations, not `generate_schemas()`). See the Linear issue for full detail.
