Ship the importable ScreamingFace Python SDK and its executable quickstart as a URL4-native
compose → run → compare path.

Superseded implementation state (not a compatibility target):

- optional `sf.config(engine=..., mode=...)`, with independent engine/data selection;
- `sf.models`, strict model dictionaries, and `sf.Fusion`/`Fusion.from_yaml`;
- `sf.MajorityVote`, `sf.ModelReducer`, canonical `.url4`, and concrete `request_for(...)`;
- `fusion.evaluate("gpqa" | "draco", first=...)`; and
- immutable `Run`/`ModelResult`/`RunFailure` execution identity and comparison results.

The existing in-process `Url4Node`, deterministic model responses, and mock/live mode have been
removed from the Phase 1 SDK. The target SDK always calls the effective HTTP URL4 engine; local
development uses the temporary Dockerized
`packages/screamingface/apps/sf-url4-engine` profile, and only that engine will reach AI Gateway
once model execution is implemented.

Documentation deliverables are:

- a deliberately small `00_quickstart.ipynb`;
- a detailed `sf_url4_engine.ipynb` request/node/response walkthrough;
- a DRACO panel/reducer/judge walkthrough;
- a brand-aligned static HTML reference covering every exported API; and
- reconciled README/spec/plan/task/work records that remove the superseded direct-gateway design.

Owner metadata sync remains required: confirm Linear priority/created date and add/register the
`pkg/screamingface-sdk` landing label in Linear and `.claude/task-board.local.md`.

## Greenfield benchmark architecture — 2026-07-18

The owner confirmed that the SDK and notebooks have no external users and authorized replacing
the current public evaluation surface without compatibility wrappers. The approved direction is
recorded in:

- `docs/plan/2026-07-18-OME-400-screamingface-benchmark-architecture.md`; and
- `docs/spec/2026-07-18-OME-400-benchmark-public-contract.md`.

Phase 0 locks universal cases, plain-Python benchmark recipes, and immutable in-memory
`Run` → `Grades` → `Report` artifacts before production implementation. Persistence and budget
enforcement are later additive contracts once their engine and storage requirements exist.

## Phase 1 implementation — 2026-07-18

Implemented the network-free public value layer and strict remote discovery/loading boundary:

- `sf.config`, immutable `Case`, `Benchmark`, and `Fusion` authoring;
- namespaced reducers, graders, and aggregators;
- strict `models.list`, `benchmarks.list`, and eager `benchmarks.load`;
- typed registry, transport, manifest, and case-stream failures; and
- a real Dockerized `Url4Node` profile in the temporary package-development app location.

Phase 1 intentionally does not implement model execution, Fusion evaluation, grading,
aggregation, or authentication. A development-only Phase 1 engine-profile walkthrough documents
the implemented boundary; public quickstart and DRACO notebook regeneration remain in their
reviewed later phase.
