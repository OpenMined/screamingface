"""Corrective-loop Candidate values — panel and solo (OME-796 / OME-828).

Mental model: an exam with a proctor and limited retakes. Members draft in
parallel, the benchmark's advertised check surface marks each draft, the first
passing draft is submitted WORD-FOR-WORD, and a no-pass round buys one judge
coaching call plus a retry — at most ``max_rounds`` rounds (a cost cap, not a
target). The whole loop compiles client-side into ONE ``$candidate``
expression, so it runs on ANY benchmark that advertises a check surface.
