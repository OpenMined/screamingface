"""When the Engine reports a cost total with no per-class breakdown, say nothing.

FEATURE: per-run cost reporting (`OME-849`/`OME-861`). A provider may author ONE amount with no
split — OpenRouter does — so `url4.streaming`'s `CostBreakdown` now accepts
`Σ components <= total_usd` and the Engine publishes a total with every component at zero. The old
total-vs-parts warning therefore fired on EVERY priced run.

STORY: as a researcher reading my Report in a notebook, a successful priced run is quiet. A warning
means something is actually wrong with the numbers, so it has to stay rare enough to be worth
reading.

A separate module rather than an append to `test_engine_contract.py`: the repo's append-only gate
compares file status, so growing an existing test file reads as a modified prior test even when the
diff is purely additive.
