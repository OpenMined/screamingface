"""The text a dropped Run stream reports, cause by cause.

`websocket_disconnected` is raised from one place, so an oversized frame, a drained proxy,
a rolled Pod and a socket that never connected all arrive at the researcher as the same
sentence unless the close code is carried through. These pin that each reads differently.

Self-contained by design (sdlc rule 5), and deliberately free of any server: what is under
test is the message, not the transport that produces the exception.
