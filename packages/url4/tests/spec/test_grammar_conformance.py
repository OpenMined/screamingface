"""Grammar-conformance regressions for `OME-501` — duplicated productions.

# FEATURE: url4 expressions parse identically no matter which entry point reads
# them, and transport-only params never escape the node that received them.
#
# Each bug here is a production implemented or enforced in TWO places where only
# one copy was correct. The tests assert the two copies AGREE — they deliberately
# compare the implementation against its own sibling rather than against a
# hand-written expectation, so they stay honest if the shared rule later changes.
