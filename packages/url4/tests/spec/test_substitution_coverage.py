"""`OME-505` — every Text source binding reaches `substitute_env_vars`.

# FEATURE: `$name` interpolation and the `$$` literal-dollar escape mean the same
# thing wherever a literal lands — a source position, a binding, or a template.
#
# INVARIANT: the `$$` escape (§6.2) is resolved at SUBSTITUTION time, not lexing
# time. That is only coherent if EVERY path a literal `Text` can take to a backend
# passes through substitution; otherwise `$$` would behave differently in a source
# position than in an intent template. `compiler._lower_text` lowers every `Text`
# to a `TextNode` whose `resolve` calls `_substitute`, and `_lower_binding` routes
# its value through the same registry — so the property holds by construction.
#
# AIDEV-NOTE: these are characterization tests. The audit that produced `OME-505`
# could not confirm the BINDING sub-case; it is confirmed here. If a future lowering
# sends some Text down a path that skips `_substitute`, these fail — which is the
# entire point of pinning it.
