"""The core import graph stays framework-free.

STORY: as a library consumer I `import url4` in a process that has no web
framework — and in one that does — and either way the import pulls in no
server machinery. Serving is opt-in via the `url4[server]` extra, reached
lazily inside `_serve_forever` / `Url4Node.serve`.

# AIDEV-NOTE: this ran as a SUBPROCESS on purpose. Asserting against the test
# process's own `sys.modules` would be worthless — pytest, the conftest and
# sibling test modules have already imported plenty by then. A clean
# interpreter is the only place the claim means anything.
#
# The guarantee only has teeth when a framework is actually installed: with no
# uvicorn on the path, "url4 did not import uvicorn" is true for the boring
# reason. CI runs this suite in both configurations (see url4-tests.yml — the
# `test` job without the extra, the `serve` job with it) so the strong form is
# exercised too.
