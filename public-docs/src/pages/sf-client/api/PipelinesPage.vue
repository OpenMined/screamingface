    <p>
      A Pipeline is a <RouterLink to="/sf-client/api/recipes">Recipe</RouterLink> that passes one
      input through an ordered sequence of stages; each stage refines the previous stage's answer,
      and the last stage's answer is graded. Like every recipe it is frozen and holds no Client. The
      <RouterLink to="/sf-client/guides/pipelines">Pipelines guide</RouterLink> walks through
      building one.

        <tr>
          <td><code>name</code></td>
          <td><code>str</code></td>
          <td>
            The pipeline's name. Inferred by joining stage names with <code>-&gt;</code> unless you
            pass one.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td><code>stages</code></td>
          <td><code>tuple[Recipe, ...]</code></td>
          <td>The ordered stages, each refining the previous answer. At least one.</td>

    </table>

    <Note>
      An unnamed Pipeline nested inside another flattens into the outer pipeline's stages; a
      Pipeline you give an explicit <code>name</code> stays grouped as one stage. Naming is
      behavioral, not cosmetic: it participates in equality, so two pipelines with the same stages
      but different naming are not equal.
    </Note>

    <p>
      Any recipe also has <code>.then(stage)</code>, which appends a stage and returns a Pipeline —
      see <RouterLink to="/sf-client/api/recipes">Recipe</RouterLink>.
